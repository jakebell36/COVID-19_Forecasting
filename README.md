# COVID-19_Forecasting
Predicting the spread of COVID-19 cases and fatalities across California, Nevada, Utah, Colorado, Arizona, and New Mexico.
Predictive models generated by using data of the spread of the virus in these states, 
as well as weather data and other variables.

COVID-19_US_SW_Forecasting is the main file of all the code and graphics.
temp.html is the final results in a presentable manner.

train.csv is the actual data of COVID-19 cases and fatalities across the globe, from 1/22/2020 to 4/22/2020. This data was used to generate the models. Our models worked to predict the number of cases and fatalities from 4/23/2020 to 5/14/2020.

final_combined.csv is the data of all of the other extra variables included in generating the model.

ConfirmedCases.gif and Fatalities.gif are both animations of how our model predicted the spread of the virus in each individual state.
